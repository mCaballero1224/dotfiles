# tmux: Terminal Multiplexter

This essentilay gives you multiple windows and panes that all run from one terminal. You can also create multiple sessions, attaching and detaching from them as need be. 

**NOTE:** Make sure to install [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) as it is needed to run `tmux.conf`.
